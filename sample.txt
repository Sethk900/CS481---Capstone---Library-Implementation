AbstractMost of the salt-affected soils of the Indo-Gangetic plain in NW India do not find suitable places in the 1970 U.S. system of soil classification. According to the current class definitions, soils with high salts, ESP, pH, chromas and yellower hues key out as Typic or Aquic Calciorthids, Camborthids and Haplustalfs which does not spell out their saline-sodic nature. For land-use recommendations, the authors believe it will be useful to set these soils apart at some high categoric level in the system.It is proposed that the structural requirements for the natric horizon be modified to include horizons with high ESP (â©¾ 40) but having simple blocky structure with or without tongues of eluvial material. New subgroups, viz. Natric, within the orders of Inceptisols, Alfisols and Aridisols is suggested for the high sodium-saturated soils lacking natric horizons. For similar practical considerations, the high concentrations of salts in soils when associated with high ESP pose problems in leaching and consequently new subgroups, viz. Salic and Salic Natric, within the orders of Aridisols and Alfisols are suggested.The modifications proposed not only place more emphasis on the saline-sodic nature of these soils but also result in better groupings for practical land use.  0  false   false        0012199792  2-s2.0-0012199792      serial  JL  271789   291210  291798  291844  31   Geoderma  GEODERMA  2003-04-10  2003-04-10  2010-04-03T17:54:45  1-s2.0-0016706175900142  0016-7061(75)90014-2  0016706175900142  10.1016/0016-7061(75)90014-2  S350  S350.2  HEAD-AND-TAIL  1-s2.0-S0016706100X01668  2015-05-13T20:32:06.785557-04:00  0  0  19750701  19750731  1975  2003-04-10T00:00:00Z  rawtext articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate issuelist volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issfirst issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authlast footnotes primabst ref alllist content subj ssids   0016-7061  00167061    14   14   1   1   Volume 14, Issue 1  7  75  91   75  91    197507   July 1975  1975-07-01  1975-07-31  1975  converted-article  fla  Copyright Â© 1975 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An appraisal of the problems in classi-  fying saline--sodic soils of the Indo-Gangetic plain in NW India. Geoderma, 14: 75--91.    Most of the salt-affected soils of the Indo-Gangetic plain in NW India do not find suit-  able places in the 1970 U.S. system of soil classification. According to the current class  definitions, soils with high salts, ESP, pH, chromas and yeUower hues key out as Typic or  Aquic Calciorthids, Camborthids and Haplustalfs which does not spell out their saline--  sodic nature. For land-use recommendations, the authors believe it will be useful to set  these soils apart at some high categoric level in the system.  It is proposed that the structural requirements for the natric horizon be modified to  include horizons with high ESP (&gt; 40) but having simple blocky structure with or without  tongues of eluvial material. New subgroups, viz. Natric, within the orders of Inceptisols,  Alfisols and Aridisols is suggested for the high sodium-saturated soils lacking natric hori-  zons. For similar practical considerations, the high concentrations of salts in soils when  associated with high ESP pose problems in leaching and consequently new subgroups, viz.  Salic and Salic Natric, within the orders of Aridisols and Alfisols are suggested.  The modifications proposed not only place more emphasis on the saline--sodic nature  of these soils but also result in better groupings for practical land use.    INTRODUCTION    In India, saline and sodic softs occur to the extent of 7.0 million ha; out of  which more than 2.5 million ha occur in the arid and semi-arid regions of the  Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana (Abrol and  Bhumbla, 1971). The salt-affected softs of India have been characterised by  many authors (Kanwar and Sehgal, 1962; Raychaudhuri et al., 1962; Abrol  and Bhumbla, 1971). In most of these papers attempts have not been made  to classify these soils according to the comprehensive U.S. system of soil classi-  fication. Sehgal and Sys (1970) applied the 1967 U.S. system of soil classifi-  cation to the major soil groups of the erstwhile Punjab and suggested some     Associate Professor of Soils (Pedology); visiting Professor (from Ohio State University,  Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A.); and Soil Scientist, Central Soil Salinity Research Institute,  Karnal, respectively,    76    modifications in the system. The work on classification of the saline--sodic  soils of India has been limited, and placement of many such soils in the  American system is in question. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to  bring out problems in classifying such soils in the U.S. system of soil classi-  fication. The soils not finding appropriate places in the system have been  reviewed and new criteria and/or new soil groups proposed with the hope  that these would result in better groupings for practical land use. The modifi-  cations proposed may need further testing by the soil scientists working in  other parts of the world so as to arrive at the most reasonable classification  of such soils for their better understanding and management.    BACKGROUND    According to the Soil Taxonomy (Soft Survey Staff, 1970), nearly all the  saline---sodic softs traditionally grouped as Solanchaks, Solonetz and Soloths  can be classified in one of the following great groups: Salorthids, Natrargids,  Halaquepts, Natrustalfs, Natraqualfs, Natraquolls, or Natrustolls, depending  upon their dominant soil properties. Unlike earlier schemes, the new U.S. soil  classification system groups the soils with natric horizons in different orders  because, apart from the high sodium content, they have many other charac-  teristics and properties in common with the soils with which they are associ-  ated on the landscape. For instance, some have a mollic epipedon and qualify  for Mollisols, whereas others having an aridic soil-moisture regime are Aridisols.  The classification of such soils in different orders does not preclude grouping  together softs having natric horizons, e.g. Natrargids, Natraqualfs, Natrustalfs,  Natrustolls, etc. Softs representing these great groups and others with natric  horizons within a given area can be grouped.  The saline--sodic softs of NW India have a combination of two or more of  the following characteristics:    high electrical conductivity, ECe (10--200 mmhos/cm)  high pH (8.5--10.0)  high exchangeable sodium per cent, ESP (50--100)  yellow hues (2.5Y or yellower) with high chromas (up to 4)  lack of structural aspects necessary to qualify as a natric horizon    If the existing criteria laid down in the U.S. system are applied, most of the  saline--sodic soils of the Indo-Gangetic plain in NW India will qualify for one  of the following great groups:    Camborthids (with or without a natric subgroup)  Calciorthids (Ustochreptic)  Haplustalfs (Aquic)    The above classification does not depict some of the important properties  of these soils, such as high ESP and/or ECe. For land-use recommendations,  the soils will have to be classified in some other subgroup or great group so as    77    to identify its salt-affected nature. The modifications suggested in this paper  are designed to set apart the saline--sodic soils of the Indo-Gangetic plain in  NW India at some high categoric level within the framework of the widely  accepted U.S. system of soil classification (Soil Survey Staff, 1970). The sug-  gestions made are supported with examples of soil profiles from the area,  for which morphological and analytical data are presented.    GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS    The areas receive an annual rainfall between 450 and 600 mm, of which  70% is concentrated in the monsoon season (July--September). The mean  annual air temperature (MAT) ranges from 23.2 to 25.8 with mean sum-  mer and mean winter temperatures ranging from 31 to 33 and 13 to 16,  respectively.  Following the modified version (by Vernemmen, 1969) of Thornthwaite's  (1948) scheme, Sehgal (1970a,b) classified the area in the semi-arid (dry and  semi-dry), with small or no seasonal water surplus, and megathermai (less hot)  with a thermal efficiency regime normal to 1st and 2rid megathermal (D1-2 d,  A~ a'1-2 ). The soils generally remain dry for six months or more and moist for  three months or more in a year and hence qualify as having an ustic moisture  regime and a hyperthermic temperature regime.    MATERIALS AND METHODS    Based on regional soil surveys, five typical saline--sodic soil profiles from  the Indo-Gangetic plain in NW India and with different (ustic and aquic)  soft-moisture regimes (Fig.l) were studied. The soils occur on relatively  low-lying landscape positions and are associated with dominantly occurring  Ustochrepts or Haplustalfs.  The~soil profiles were described according to the U.S. Soil Survey Manual  (1951) and Supplement (1962). The soil samples thus collected were pro-  cessed and analysed. The particle-size analysis was conducted by the pipette  method (Piper, 1950). The pH and electrical conductivity were estimated on  a zeromatic Beckman pH meter using glass electrodes and with a solu-bridge,  respectively (Richards, 1954). The organic carbon was determined by Walkley  and Black's rapid titration method (Piper, 1950), and calcium carbonate by a  valumetric method in which the carbonates were decomposed by acid (2N HC1)  and the volume of CO2 evolved measured in a standard calcimetric flask. The  cation,exchange capacity was estimated by using the sodium-acetate method  (Richards, 1954). The exchangeable sodium was determined by extracting  the soil solution with neutral N--NH4OAc and sodium was determined by  flame emission using a Beckman 'B' spectrophotometer having a photometry  attachment, and ESP was calculated. The analysis of the saturation extract  was done following the methods outlined in the USDA Handbook No.60  (Richards, 1954); soluble calcium and magnesium were determined by the    78    68 i    iNDIA    "-" Jt".'L      f /  ( .;:, r2"    72"  i    f.  f.

DISCUSSION AND CLASSIFICATION OF PROBLEM SOILS    Classification of high-sodium soils with argillic horizons (Profiles i and 2)    The natric horizon as presently defined is a special kind of argillic horizon.  It has, in addition to the properties of an argillic horizon:    1. a.  A prismatic or, more commonly, columnar structure, or  b.  rarely, a blocky structure with tongues of an eluvia] horizon with uncoated silt or  sand grains extending more than 2.5 cm into the horizon.    79    2. a. More than 15% saturation with exchangeable sodium in some sub-horizon within  40 cm of the upper boundary, or    b. more exchangeable sodium + magnesium than calcium + exchangeable acidity (at pH  8.2) in some sub-horizon within 40 cm of the upper boundary if the underlying C  horizon has more than 15% saturation with sodium in some part.  Observations of many saline---sodic pedons of the Indo-Gangetic plain in  NW India show that the clay-enriched horizons with high ESP's (/&gt; 40) do  not qualify as natric horizons because they lack prismatic or columnar struc-  ture and blocky structure with tongues of an eluvial horizon. Some may have  a tendency towards prismatic structure if allowed to remain exposed for 1--2  months. Similar softs have been observed in the Jordan Valley (Alperovitch  and Dan, 1972). For practical land use, these soils pose problems similar to  those of their other counterparts with columnar or prismatic structure. When  classified in the system now, they key out as Haplustalfs rather than Natru-  stalfs.  Several changes in the existing definition of the natric horizon are proposed  to accomodate these high-sodium softs. The first proposal is to broaden the  definition of the natric horizon to include horizons having high ESP (40 or  more) and simple blocky structure with or without tongues of eluvial mate-  rial. The second proposal is to introduce a natric subgroup for the softs high  in ESP (15--39) but lacking structural characteristics required for a natric  horizon.    Redefining natric horizon (proposal 1)  Pedons 1 and 2, representing typical Solonetz of the Indo-Gangetic alluvial  plain, include horizons with all properties of an argillic horizon including the  oriented clay coatings as observed under the microscope, and have 50--90%  sodium saturation of the exchange complex. These horizons will not qualify  as natric horizons because they lack columnar or prismatic structure or blocky  structure with tongues of the eluvial horizon. As a result, many such softs of  the Indo-Gangetic plain will key out as Haplustalfs or, rarely, as Ochraqualfs.  This does not emphasize major characteristics of these softs nor does it help  in setting apart these softs for formulating suitable management practices for  growing crops. Because these softs, for all practical purposes, are similar to  the ones having natric horizons, except for structural aspects, we believe that  the definition of the natric horizon be broadened with regard to its structural  aspects for soils rich in sodium so as to require either:    a prismatic or, more commonly, columnar structure, or rarely, a blocky structure with or  without tongues of an eluvial horizon for soils having 40% saturation or more with sodium  throughout the argillic horizon.    This would help to achieve a practical classification of these Solonetz softs as  Natraqualfs* (Pedon 1) and Natrustalfs (Pedon 2). The geographic occurrence  *Aqualf in accordance with the criteria proposed earlier by Sehgal and Sys (1970).    80    of such softs on low-lying landscape positions in association with Haplustalfs  and Alfic Ustochrepts also supports the proposed modification.    Use of natric subgroups (proposal 2)  For the softs having sufficient saturation with sodium (15 to less than 40%)  throughout the argiUic horizon to cause dispersion and affect plant growth,  we suggest a natric subgroup within the great group of Haplustalfs. This proposal  would require inclusion of a statement for the typic subgroup, such as:    "have exchangeable sodium less than 15% of the cation-exchange capacity (at pH 8.2)  throughout the argillic horizon".    Thus, the soils presently qualifying as Typic Haplustalfs and having more  than 15% exchangeable sodium would become Natric Haplustalfs. This would  also take care at the subgroup level of the softs with horizons having blocky  structure with tongues of eluvial material and having an ESP from 15 to less  than 40. This proposal follows the reasoning advanced in the 1970 revision of  the U.S. system of soft classification wherein the Natric I-Iaploxeralfs are  similarly defined. The above proposal also finds support from G.D. Smith  (1973, personal communication).  Similarly, other softs (Pedon 3) having a high ESP, high ECe, a calcic hori-  zon within I m of the surface and hues of 10YR with chromas of 2 or more,  and an ustic soft-moisture regime will key out as Ustochreptic Calciorthids  according to the existing criteria. This classification does not place any em-  phasis on their saline--sodic nature. Such softs in the earlier system qualified  as Solonetz and according to Richards (1954) as saline--sodic. This pedon (3),  having high ECe values (2 or more) and an ustic soft-moisture regime, would  qualify for the great group of Calciorthids because of the high salt content  which impairs the availability of water for plants. In order to depict the sodic  nature of these softs at subgroup level, another subgroup, viz. natric, within  the Calciorthids is necessary. To accomplish this, it is proposed to add one  more clause to the definition of Typic Calciorthids, viz.:    "have less than 40% saturation with sodium throughout the cambic horizon if the satu-  rated hydraulic conductivity is slow or very slow".    In view of the above, all softs like the typic except for high sodium saturation  (with ESP of 40 or more) would be classified as Natric Calciorthids; those  with ESP of 40 or more and having characteristics associated with wetness  within 75 cm of the surface (after Sehgal and Sys, 1970), would qualify as  Natraquic Calciorthids (Pedon 3). Similarly, those with an ustic soil-moisture  regime would qualify as Natrustochreptic Calciorthids. The reasoning is in  line with that for the proposed subgroup of Natric Camborthids (Soft Survey  Staff, 1970).  Some pedons (e.g. Pedon 4) with low ECe (~ 2 mmhos/cm), high ESP  (40% or more), occurring in the broad ustic soil-moisture regime and having  characteristics associated with wetness within 75 cm of the surface will quali-    81    fy, according to the existing criteria, as Aquic Ustochrepts which does not  place any emphasis on the high ESP values. In order to emphasize the high  ESP values, we propose the introduction of two more subgroups, viz. natric  and natraquic, within the Ustochrepts for soils qualifying for typic except  for high ESP and for aquic characteristics by adding two more clauses in the  existing definition of the typic subgroup of Ustochrepts as:    (i) "have less than 40% of saturation with sodium throughout the cambic horizon if satu-  rated hydraulic conductivity is slow or very slow".    (ii) "have no mottles with chromas of 2 or less within 75 cm of the surface, or  in the thermic or hyperthermic temperature regimes, have no chromas of 4 or less in hues  of 2.5Y or yellower accompanied by mottles or Fe--Mn concretions, or both within 75 cm  of the surface".  (after Sehgal and Sys, 1970)    This would bring all soils except for (i) in a natric subgroup and all others  except for (i) and (ii) in a natraquic subgroup within the Ustochrepts. The  proposed classification allows setting apart soils with high ESP at the sub-  group level.    Proposed salic subgroup    The soils studied (Pedons 5 and 1) generally have an accumulation of salts  at the surface, the amount of which decreases sharply with depth. In the  pedons studied, the amounts of salts and the thickness of the saline layer are  not enough to qualify for salic horizons. The high salt content when associated  with the high ESP reduces appreciably the hydraulic conductivity. Although  the system provides phases, as a taxonomic unit, to take care of high salts at  the surface, yet we believe that the high salt content, when associated with  high ESP, may not permit easy removal of salts and hence make the reclama-  tion process difficult. Therefore, we propose that high amounts of salts, when  associated with high degrees of sodium saturation, should be indicated at  some higher level than the phase. For practical considerations, we suggest  the introduction of salic and salic natric subgroups within the great groups  of Calciorthids, Camborthids, Natrargids, Natrustalfs, Natraqualfs, Halaquepts,  etc.  In the existing definitions of the typic subgroups of Halaquepts and other  soils with natric horizons, e.g. Natrustalfs, Natraqualfs, Natrargids, etc., we  propose that the following clause 'a' be introduced:  'a' "do not have an average minimum of 1% salts (when associated with 15% or more  saturation with sodium) with a minimum thickness of 15 cm and the product of  the per cent salts and thickness is not 30 or more within 75 cm of the surface".  Hence, all soils like the typic except for clause 'a' (above) will qualify for  salic subgroups within great groups of Halaquepts, Natrustalfs, Natraqualfs,  Natrargids, etc., as for instance, Salic Natraqualfs (Pedon 1), Salic--Aeric    82    Halaquept (Pedon 5). Similarly we propose that in the existing definitions  of the typic subgroups of Camborthids and Calciorthids, the following clause  'b' be added:    'b' "do not have an average minimum of 1% salts when associated with 40% or more satu-  ration with sodium with minimum thickness of 15 cm and the product of the percent-  age salts and thickness is not 30 or more within 75 cm of the surface".  Hence, all soils like the typic except for the clause 'b' (above) would qualify  for Salic Natric Calciorthids or Salic Natric Camborthids. The introduction  of salic subgroups for the high-sodium saturation soils yields a practical  classification for land-use planning.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    To Dr. Guy D.

Abstract   Most of the salt-affected soils of the Indo-Gangetic plain in NW India do not find suitable places in the 1970 U.S. system of soil classification. According to the current class definitions, soils with high salts, ESP, pH, chromas and yellower hues key out as Typic or Aquic Calciorthids, Camborthids and Haplustalfs which does not spell out their saline-sodic nature. For land-use recommendations, the authors believe it will be useful to set these soils apart at some high categoric level in the system.  It is proposed that the structural requirements for the natric horizon be modified to include horizons with high ESP (â©¾ 40) but having simple blocky structure with or without tongues of eluvial material. New subgroups, viz. Natric, within the orders of Inceptisols, Alfisols and Aridisols is suggested for the high sodium-saturated soils lacking natric horizons. For similar practical considerations, the high concentrations of salts in soils when associated with high ESP pose problems in leaching and consequently new subgroups, viz. Salic and Salic Natric, within the orders of Aridisols and Alfisols are suggested.  The modifications proposed not only place more emphasis on the saline-sodic nature of these soils but also result in better groupings for practical land use.
